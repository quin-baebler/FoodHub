# FoodHub

This full-stack Android Application is a calorie tracker/meal planner application made with Kotlin that uses the FatSecret API so that a user can search up a food and get its nutrition information including calories, fat, protein, and carbs. This application has a backend and API we created and hosted on Azure that we use to store the data including posts, meals, logs, food items, and comments. With this data we can use the API we made to get the data in JSON format so we can parse through and reformat the information we need. This API also allows us to add posts, comments, and food to the database through POST requests.
